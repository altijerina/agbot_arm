[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_planning_scene_interface.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "moveit_planning_scene_interface", but CMake
  did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_planning_scene_interface" with any of the following names:

    moveit_planning_scene_interfaceConfig.cmake
    moveit_planning_scene_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_planning_scene_interface" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "moveit_planning_scene_interface_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "moveit_planning_scene_interface" provides a separate development package
  or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
