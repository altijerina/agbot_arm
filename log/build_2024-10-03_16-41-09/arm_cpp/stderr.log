[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findplanning_scene_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "planning_scene_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "planning_scene_interface" with any of the following names:

    planning_scene_interfaceConfig.cmake
    planning_scene_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "planning_scene_interface" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "planning_scene_interface_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "planning_scene_interface" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
